<p> <br> Michael Barton is a Professor in the School of Complex Adaptive Systems and in the School of Human Evolution & Social Change, and Director of the Center for Social Dynamics & Complexity at Arizona State University (USA). He also directs the Network for Computational Modeling in Social and Ecological Sciences (<a href="https://comses.net">CoMSES.Net</a>), an international scientific network to enable accessibility, open science, and best practices for computation in the socio-ecological sciences. Barton received his BA from the University of Kansas in Anthropology/Archaeology, and MA and PhD from the University of Arizona in Anthropology/Archaeology and Geosciences. His research centers around long-term human ecology and landscape dynamics, integrating computational modeling, geospatial technologies, and data science with geoarchaeological field studies. Barton has directed transdisciplinary research on hunter-gatherers and small-holder farmers in the Mediterranean and North America for over three decades, and collaborates on research on human-environmental interactions in the modern world. He is a member of the open-source GRASS GIS Development Team and Project Steering Committee, dedicated to making advanced geospatial technologies openly accessible to the world.
